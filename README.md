# Tester's Portfolio

# Introduction about me
Welcome!
I am a graduate of technical and IT studies in the field of Computer Aided Engineering Processes at the AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow. I have worked so far as a constructor-technologist in a foundry and as a cost estimator in construction and metal processing companies. Since May 2023, I decided to become a software tester. I intend to take the next stationary exam ISTQB Certified Tester - Basic Level conducted by the [Association of Information Systems Quality](https://sjsi.org/).
# Tools used
* **MS Excel** - advanced support, excluding macro support. I have been using this tool successively for years both at university and at work.
* **Oracle database** - selected from other databases on the market due to functionality and popularity. For learning SQL and later PL/SQL. For educational purposes, a repository linked to my own database will be created, on which I will execute scripts.
* **GIT** - program already installed locally to learn how to use it in the near future.
* **Jira** - for future learning. A free account has been created, which will be used for educational purposes after taking the appropriate course.
